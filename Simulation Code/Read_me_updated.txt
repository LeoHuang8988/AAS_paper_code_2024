Note: 
- Figure A2 was generated using 'Graph generation v3.1.1.1.R' in the 'Simulation Plot' folder; the relevant baseline simulation results for those four cases were computed using 'CRRA Projections.R'.
- The results for Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 were generated from 'CRRA Projections.R'.
- The code file 'CRRA Projections.R' is also applicable to those scenario/sensitivity test outcomes; consequently, the simulation results for Table 6, Table A1, Table A2, and Table A3 were generated with altered parameter values and related optimisation result data in the relevant code.
- Building on 'CRRA Projections.R', the updated code file 'CRRA Projections_updated.R' includes additional code for calculating the 95% and 99% VaR and CVaR.
- The results for Table 6 was generated from 'CRRA Projections_updated.R'.
- The code file 'CRRA Projections_updated.R' is also applicable to those scenario/sensitivity test outcomes; consequently, the simulation results for Table A4, Table A5, Table A6, and Table A7 were generated with altered parameter values and related optimisation result data in the relevant code.
